# serial-temp-sense-log
This is a rust program that reads the serial port of a raspberry pi pico and parses out the temperature.
There is a raspberry pi circuit-python program as well as a rust program to interpret it. 

The serial solution works wonderful at the moment, I have no issues with using it for over 24 hours straight on my linux server. My next focus is using a pico W to host a web server that has the info on it.
